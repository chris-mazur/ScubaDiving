## About

Game project developed at the Paulista University on sustainable development. The Scuba Diving Game has a didactic purpose of helping other people understand a little about sustainability, with the main scenario being a scuba diver who collects garbage at the bottom of the ocean.

## How does it work?

Scuba Diving Game was developed through a 2D Java Game Library, called Slick2D. Slick2d is an easy to use set of tools and utilites wrapped around LWJGL and OpenGL bindings to make 2D Java game development easier.

## Instalattion

Following the steps of Slick2D [wiki](http://slick.ninjacave.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page)
#### Downloading and Extracting Slick2D and LWJGL
1. Download [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/)
2. Download LWJGL **[2.9.3](https://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.9.3/)**
3. Extract the LWJGL zip (lwjgl-x.x.zip) file somewhere in your computer, remember or note down the location, you will need this later. We suggest you create a library (/lib) folder to store all these files in a well-known place.

#### Setting Up Slick2D and LWJGL in NetBeans
Extracted from LWJGL with Netbeans
1. Open up NetBeans.
2. Go to Tools --> Libraries in the menu bar.
3. Click on the New Library button.
4. Type in Slick2D or any other name that you want for the Library Name.
5. Select Classpath tab for your newly created Library and then click the Add JAR/Folder... button.
6. Go to where you extracted lwjgl-X.X.zip and add the following '.jar'('Ctrl' or 'Alt' to select multiple files)
   1. lwjgl.jar
   2. slick.jar
   3. jinput.jar
   4. lwjgl_util.jar (if want to use OpenGL's GLU class)

#### Setting Up a Project to use LWJGL in NetBeans
In a new Java project:
1. Right-Click your project node or go to File>Project Properties and select Libraries
2. Add your Slick2D Library , created as instructed above
3. Select Run
4. On VM Options put the following:
   `-Djava.library.path=<lwjgl-X.X path>/native/<linux|macosx|solaris|windows>`
   
Note: Remember to select the natives of your operating system.

After all the steps above, the Scuba Diving Game project can now be compiled.
