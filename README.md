## Scuba Diving Game

### About

Project developed at the Paulista University on sustainable development. The Scuba Diving Game has a didactic purpose of helping other people understand a little about sustainability, with the main scenario being a scuba diver who collects garbage at the bottom of the ocean.

### How does it work?

Scuba Diving Game was developed through a 2D Java Game Library, called Slick2D. Slick2d is an easy to use set of tools and utilites wrapped around LWJGL and OpenGL bindings to make 2D Java game development easier.

### How to configure?

#### Downloading and Extracting Slick2D and LWJGL
1. Download Slick2D
2. Download LWJGL standard bundle
3. Extract the LWJGL zip (lwjgl-x.x.zip) file somewhere in your computer, remember or note down the location, you will need this later. We suggest you create a library (/lib) folder to store all these files in a well-known place.
4. As of 9/16, the above Slick2D link will download a version that is not compatible with LWJGL 3. Try **bold** 2.9.3 instead.
Setting Up Slick2D and LWJGL in NetBeans
Extracted from LWJGL with Netbeans

Open up NetBeans.
Go to Tools --> Libraries in the menu bar.
Click on the New Library button.
Type in Slick2D or any other name that you want for the Library Name.
Select Classpath tab for your newly created Library and then click the Add JAR/Folder... button.
Go to where you extracted lwjgl-X.X.zip and add the following '.jar'('Ctrl' or 'Alt' to select multiple files)
lwjgl.jar
slick.jar
jinput.jar
lwjgl_util.jar (if want to use OpenGL's GLU class)
